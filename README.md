# opendicomiris


derived from OsiriX open-source version (june 2018) found in https://github.com/pixmeo/osirix

## code laboratory
Contrarily to OsiriX http://www.pixmeo.com, opendicomiris has NO customer relationship with people using the app. Neither do we pretend to form a caring community where people help each other. We assume no liability if the app doesn't work or ceases to work. Every one is on his/her own responsibility. Every one can dig in the code and fix it for his/her needs.

Our aim in working in opendicomiris is to learn from the very fast working creators of the amazing OsiriX, and on a much slower pace, to simplify drastically the design and experiment new technologies. We'll try to document these evolutions in the issues and wiki of the github repository.

As far as metodology is concerned, we feel much easier to derive from something which was working (OsiriX) than to start an entirely new project. Thanks to Antoine, Joris and team for letting it beeing posible.

## decisions of design

We compile always on the latest publically available macos and don't pretend backward compatibility.

We DO NOT implement the now obsolete DICOM big endian transfer syntax.
